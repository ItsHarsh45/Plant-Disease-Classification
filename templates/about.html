                <p>
                    The Plant Disease Classification project uses deep learning techniques to identify diseases in plants based on images of their leaves. This tool aims to help farmers, gardeners, and plant enthusiasts quickly diagnose plant health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our model is trained on a diverse dataset of plant images, covering various species and common diseases. By leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks, we can provide accurate and rapid disease identification.
                </p>
                <h3>How it works:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Upload an image of a plant leaf</li>
                    <li>Our AI model analyzes the image</li>
                    <li>Receive a diagnosis of potential diseases or confirm healthy status</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This project is continuously evolving, and we're always working to improve its accuracy and expand the range of plants and diseases it can identify.
